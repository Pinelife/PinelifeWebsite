<h1>Planning Page!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>

<p>Things I want to do on Pinelife.net:</h3>
<p>Mostly I just want to make a website as confounding and engaging and pointless as <a href ="http://www.id-ds.com/">this one</a>. That website is the coolest thing I've seen in ages and I'm jealous that I don't have anything like it. They evidently just put anything they want up there: essays about footnotes in fiction, pictures of their car, etc. I like that it has no clear theme and seems to just be a dumping ground for everything in their life. I also like the style of the site with light pinks and fuzzy photos from French films.</p>
<p>Other than that:</p>
<ul>	
	<li>Include a journaling element: how <em>was</em> my day really? I'm sure the world is on the edge of its seat</li>
	<li>Fill it with weird and self-indulgent content including:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A million YouTube and SoundCloud hip hop tracks</li>
			<li>Photos I don't wanna put on Facebook</li>
			<li>Recipes I pretend to myself that I will one day try</li>
			<li>Stupid things I find funny</li>
			<li>Bits of books I'm reading</li>
			<li>Dumb mood boards with juxtaposed pics of raccoons eating human food from rubbish bins and pretty high school teachers all dolled up for court after they got busted banging their students</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Practice some of the things I've learned on Codecademy by making crappy little apps</li>
	<li>Include a bunch of stuff which only displays when you mouse over with your cursor: keep an eye out for celeb nudes, salacious gossip, family secrets, etc.</li>
	<li>Tangent: I remember this website I found when I was maybe 16 and it was just one page which was blank except for black text which read 'Not down this rabbit hole Alice" which I thought was very cool until one of my guy friends said it was probably a buttsex joke</li>
	<li>I finally wanna put together my Insecurity Corner: wanna crush me? Consult this page (Coming in 2017)</li>
	<li>Review Chinese resturants in Melbourne: criteria to include crispiness of dumplings, cheapness of beer, cleaniness of bathrooms, apparent happiness of sealife in display tank, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>I basically just want to make an online scrapbook or journal.
So this is my first page. I guess now I'll work on the navigation. And I should probably do some CSS too. I'm excited. Was beginning to worry I'd never actually do this.
</p>

<p>Also: I'm going to try my best not to be slack about this. I've actually gone to the effort of indenting my code so far. And maybe I'll check it's HTML compliant and accessible, etc. just to be a good girl (haha so far it's not compliant. W3Schools seems to have some kind of beef with nested unordered lists. Lame.)</p>
