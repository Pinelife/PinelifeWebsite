    <td>Decor/Bathroom Cleanliness</td>
    <td>5/10</td>
    <td>White and wood, I think. No pictures of koi or Chinese landmarks so -5 points for that. I love tacky decorations and this place had none. Bathrooms were very clean though.</td>

    <td>Quality of Conversation</td>
    <td>8/10</td>
    <td>Interesting but maybe a bit tense because I was being rude about <a href = "http://theviewfromhell.blogspot.com.au/2012/09/trying-to-see-through-unified-theory-of.html">this</a> article which Matt liked.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Cringing Servility of Waitstaff/Probability That They Would Recognise A Regular</td>
    <td>5/10</td>
    <td>Not sure what I'm even looking for here - do I want them to be servile or not? Probably not. And the other bit: if I go somewhere all the time, do I want to be recognised/acknowledged as a regular? I think not but... the place I go quite often for banh mi during lunch: they recognise me and call me darling and I cherish their affection. At New Kum Den BBQ (AKA heaven on Earth) most of the staff recognise Meowgre and I and know our regular order, which I think I like. You would have to work incredibly hard to be recognised as a regular by Din Tai Fung - probably 4+ visits a day 7 days a week to really be recognised around that place. It's huge and frantic and everyone seems industrious and completely disinterested in interacting with customers in anything more than a mechanical 'I'm here to work' type way. I don't mind that vibe, but it makes it feel like the kind of place you can't linger.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Salacious Conversation Safe?</td>
    <td>9/10</td>
    <td>You could talk about just about anything here. The waitstaff don't hover and it's just loud enough so that the next table over can't hear your juicy gossip.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Music</td>
    <td>3/10</td>
    <td>Mostly couldn't hear anything over the misc. din of the restaurant except when we were leaving they played that song from <em>Fast and Furious 7</em> (7 Fast, 7 Furious - WAY more furious this time like you would not believe. So furious that it actually takes away from some of the fastness because their hands are shaking so much they can't gun it the way they usually would)</td>
  </tr>  
    <tr>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td>30/60</td>
    <td>Final Remarks: I would go again! 50% seems low but my criteria are pretty bogus so I really wouldn't pay any attention to the scores. We had walked past this place before and I'd imagined some kind of dumpling wonderland - because I'm a fried-only kinda girl I was sort of disappointed by the dumplings. Going here at 7pm on a Saturday night meant that it was packed with a million people all trying to get laid and shove as many dumplings as possible down their throats like a pack of hungry pelicans (myself included). This is a place without much charm or personality - if you said that about a person it would be crushing, but for a food joint I guess it's just standard.</td>
