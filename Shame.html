Wanna read an essay I wrote in uni about <i>The Bell Jar</i>? I was 22 when I wrote this. It features illustrations I drew in MS Paint and some absurd acronyms I invented myself which make the essay significantly harder to follow.

My essay engages with Suzanne Ferguson's argument in her essay "<a href ="https://test.qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/212852/mod_resource/content/1/Ferguson%20-%20Defining%20the%20Short%20Story.pdf">Defining the Short Story: Impressionism and Form</a>" where she basically discusses the key features of the modern novel (and obviously some stuff about short stories). You don't need to read her essay to get what I'm going on about but it might help.

Now we're getting into really embarrassing territory: the first bit of a script I wrote when I was 22. This is actually so bad that I've removed the final 3 pages because it just descends into a deep crevasse of cringe - I know this is my shame corner but I'm going to need to work up to it. What's weird is I probably felt quite proud of this when I first wrote it. I wanted to write a rom com where the protagonists are trying to dispose of a body: this idea haunts me. I don't know why but even now I would still like to write something in this general area: set in Werribee, callous idiot protagonists, frantic internet research for how best to dispose of a body, love blossoms as they drag the corpse into the bush.
