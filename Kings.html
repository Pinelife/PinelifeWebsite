<h1>One Girl's Quest To Understand and Enjoy The World's Densest Game</h1>
<p>I'm a long time fan of strategy games like <em>Civ V</em> and <em>Age of Empires II</em> - I don't mean to brag but despite clocking in hundreds of hours in these games I am still really terrible. I guess I have no strategy. When I first started playing <em>Civ V</em> I just took it as a matter of course that I would get thumped because I was new and still figuring out how everything works. 200 hours in and I'm still getting thumped. I've improved a bit - I can play at chieftan or warlord level now (which is basically easy - normal) without getting rekt too early in the game. My strategy is basically:
<ul>
<li>Try to grab as much land as possible early on</li>
<li>Underinvest in military</li>
<li>Funnel all money into stupid stuff like theatres and stadiums (I want my people to be <em>very</em> entertained)</li>
<li>Don't start shit war-wise until you have nuclear weapons</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>What's really surprising is that I've somehow managed to clock up 17 hours of <em>CK2</em>. I have quit <em>CK2</em> games so frequently out of pure frustration - usually about 20 minutes in. Even the tutorial is insanely difficult to navigate. On the <em>CK2</em> subreddit they have a bunch of beginners guides - even following these I can't do it. Feel kind of like a failure. But also: maybe I haven't been trying that hard. BUT THEN AGAIN: 17 fucking hours. What have I been doing?</p>
<br/>

<br/>
<p>Normally I'd just leave it on the shelf and not worry about it: I've already played it more than <em>Gone Home</em> plus I got it for like $7 during last year's Steam summer sale so it's not like I've wasted lots of money on it (literally just my time at this point... which we all know is valueless) but this seriously sounds like the world's craziest game and I want in:
<ul>
<li><a href ="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/4w9al1/can_anyone_explain_why_my_daughter_is_such_a/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=browse&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=CrusaderKings">"SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK I AM THE FUCKING EMPEROR OF BRITAIN, SPAIN, AND BYZANTIUM AND THIS UNGRATEFUL BITCH DECIDED TO FUCK A 60 YEAR OLD HUNCHBACK MERCENARY DESPITE THE FACT SHE IS THE HEIR TO HALF THE DAMN KNOWN WORLD.
She elopes and I think l, ok, as long as she marries soon (is 25) and make a boy I'll be ok. Invite back to court? No. She won't marry anyone because her lover(60 year old hunchback) refuses my offers."</a></li>
<li>Don't think I've ever seen a game where you can commit suicide before (well, I mean, you can shoot your foot with a rocket launcher in <em>Halo</em> and that'll get the job done, but it's never like it is in <em>CK2</em> where you get to choose between poison, hanging yourself or flinging yourself off the castle parapets)</li>
<li>The subreddit is full of niche and incredibly weird jokes which I really want to get - apparently it's possible for your character to become a werewolf... and it's also possible to play as a horse so your ruler can be a horse who is also a werewolf. I need this in my life</li>
<li>You can get all these cool mods so instead of cruddy old Europe you're playing in Middle Earth or Westeros - as a long time console pleb I am excited to try out some mods</li>	
</ul>
<hr/>
Anyway: I am going to document my attempts at learning how to play this game.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>STEP 1</b>: install <em>LOTR</em> mod - hopefully get to encounter Gollum at some point. Probably this is a bad idea and I am making things more complicated than they need to be. But I wanna hang out in Middle Earth rather than Europe</p>

<br/>
<p>But does it work? Nope. Crashed to desktop. Can't be fucked troubleshooting - just gonna play a vanilla game.
